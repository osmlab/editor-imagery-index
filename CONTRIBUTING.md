## Contributing

The 'source' documents for this project are the .json files in `sources`. To add
a new imagery source, add a new file to this directory.

After you've made a modification, run `make` to generate `imagery.xml`, `imagery.json`,
and `imagery.geojson`. Generating these files requires Python.
